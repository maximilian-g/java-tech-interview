 * There is NxN grid, content of which is 0 and 1, 1 - is a ship(or part of ship)
 * Grid size can be any length, but grid it is always NxN grid.
 * There can be any number of ships.
 * Ship size - from 1x1 to 1xN.
 * Ships are not connected with each other.
 *
 * For example in 3x3 grid - grid[0][0] - grid[0][2] is a 1x3 ship.
 * But other ship already cannot be on grid[1][x], because ships should not connect.
 * From this requirement and given data, other ship(s) can be located only in grid[2][x]
